<p><strong>Measured Response Variable vs Attribute Explanatory Variable</strong></p>
<p>There are many cases to which this data analysis situation is applicable. For example, if you would like to investigate if there is a gender pay gup in an organisation or if a chemical engineer wants to compare the hardness of five blends of paint you would conduct MvsA DA to reach a conclusion.</p>
<p>The focus of investigation is the response variable for which we seek to descrbe its variability and its causes. We use the explanatory variable to explore if its behaviour influences the changes in the response variable, ie. does the responds variable responds to the changes in the explanatory variable? We seek to find out if the variability in the response variable can be explained by the explanatory variable.</p>
<p>As in this data analysis situation focal point of our attention is the measured response variable, we put our focus on to its distribution. Since we investigate influence on its behaviours caused by the change in the attribute explanatory variable we apply the following underlying concept:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a relationship between a measured response and an attribute explanatory variable if the average value of the response is dependent on the level of the attribute explanatory variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the case of the measured response variable versis the attribute expplanatory variable with two levels (M vs A(2)), this can be illustrated graphically by plotting the statistical distribution of the response variable for the two attribute levels as below:</p>
<p><img src="/module1/StatsConcepts/images/MvAMethodology.png?width=40pc" /></p>
<p><strong>There is no link:</strong>
&gt; Given a measured response and an attribute explanatory variable with two levels, red (attribute level 1) &amp; blue (attribute level 2). If the statistical distribution of the response variable for attribute level 1 and attribute level 2 are exactly the same then the level of the attribute variable has no influence on the value response, there is no relationship.</p>
<p><strong>There is a link:</strong>
&gt; Given a measured response and an attribute explanatory variable with two levels, red (attribute level 1) &amp; blue (attribute level 2). If the statistical distribution of the response variable for attribute level 1 and attribute level 2 have different means then the level of the attribute variable does influence the response variable.</p>
<p><strong>Illustrative Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Response Variable:</strong> Amount Spent on Clothes per month</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Attribute Explanatory Variable:</strong> Gender (Male/Female)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If Males and Females <em>have the same</em> ‘spending on clothes’ <em>characteristics</em> then the average amounts spent monthly by Males and by Female should be <em>the same</em>.</p>
<p>If Male and Females <em>have different</em> ‘spending on clothes’ <em>characteristics</em> then the average amount spent monthly by Males and Female would be <em>different</em>.</p>
<p>The definition uses the concept of a statistical distribution and the idea that the total population can be split into two or more sub-populations according to the level of the attribute. (i.e. in the illustrative example a population of Males and a population of Females). Then comparing the distributions and asking are they the same (no relationship) or do they differ in the means (there is a relationship).</p>
<p>{{% notice note %}}
It is sufficient to require equal means for no connection and unequal means for a connection irrespective of the shape/structure of the distributions.

<p><strong>Working wih sample data</strong></p>
<p>The concepts above provide a clear framework for analysis. Working with sample data, which by definition is imperfect information and subject to sampling error, makes working with sample data more problematical. The analyst need to ask the key question is the sample data providing evidence of a real connection or is it a consequence of sampling error?</p>
<p>The common data analysis methodology introduced in the previous section provides a well defined methodology for working with sample data.</p>
<p>The basic question to be answered is:
Is there a connection/link between the response variable and the explanatory variable?</p>
<p>{{% notice warning %}}
This requires a definition of what is meant by connection/link.

<blockquote>
<p>The Initial Data Analysis <strong>I.D.A.</strong> is a set of simple descriptive procedures that enable the data analyst to make one of three judgements:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>There is clearly no link between the response variable and the explanatory variable.</p></li>
<li><p>There is clearly a link between the response variable and the explanatory variable.</p></li>
<li><p>The sample evidence is unclear using these simple descriptive methods that more advanced methods are required to resolve the issue. In which case Further Data Analysis (FDA) is required.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The resulting conclusions from the further data analysis <strong>F.D.A.</strong> can be one of two options:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The outcome of the analysis suggests that there is no connection/link/relationship between the response variable and the explanatory variable, and then the analysis is complete.</p></li>
<li><p>The outcome of the analysis suggests that the level of the explanatory variable influences on the response variable, (i.e. there is a connection/link/relationship), then to complete the analysis the nature of the connection needs to be described.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<pre class="txt"><code>To complete the data analysis the analyst needs to know how to perform the following three stages:

 -  What is the Initial Data analysis and how to interpret it
 -  How to perform the further data analysis if required
 -  How to describe the nature of any connection discovered.</code></pre>
<hr />
<p><strong>The Initial Data Analysis</strong></p>
<p>In general the Initial Data Analysis consists of constructing the mean value and a boxplot of the response variable for each level of the Attribute explanatory variable. Given a data sample the problem is how to construct the required means and boxplots.</p>
<p><strong>Case Study: Share Price Study</strong></p>
<p>Statistical data are usually organised as tables. Each row of the table represents an observation, whilst a column represent a variable.</p>
<p>A business analyst is studying share prices of companies from three different business sectors. As part of the study a random sample (n=60) of companies was selected and the following data was collected:</p>
<table>

<tr class="header">

<p>Let us explore the distributions of the variables visually using the appropriate graphs. As we have discussed in the previous sections, we usualy use piechart or a barplot if you like to graph an attribute variable.</p>

<p>We have learnt that histogram is appropriate to graphically explore a measured variable.</p>

<p>To see the density smoothing of the histogram, on your histogram you will plot the probability density rather than the freqeuncy of the measured variable, over which you can superimpose kernel density smoothing line.</p>

<p>Exploratory analysis of the individual variables is important part of DA process as a way to familiarise with data and identify any anomalies that may be contained within the individual variables. However, the most exciting part of Data Analysis is exploration of the possible relationships between the variables and statistical modelling that we use in this part of DA process.</p>
<p>The main focus in this study is <em>the study of share prices of companies from three different business sectors</em>, ultimately this will help us to identify the <strong>response</strong> variable for this study which is <strong>Share_Price</strong> that is a <strong>measured</strong> type. In this section we are learning how to investigate a possible relationship between measured response and attribute with two levels explanatory variable. In this study there are two attribute variables with two levels: <strong>Competition</strong> and <strong>Type</strong> and both of those attribute variable seem reasonable to use as explanatory variables.</p>
<p>We will start the investigation for the case: <strong>Share_Price</strong> vs <strong>Competition</strong>.</p>
<p>Using data analysis methodology for M v A(2)</p>
<p><img src="/module1/StatsConcepts/images/MvAMethodology.png?width=40pc" /></p>
<p>We first need to conduct the IDA. For this part of the analysis we need to obtain the descriptive statistics and their visualisations in terms of the boxplots.</p>
<p><em>Step 1:</em> Obtain the descriptive statistic of the response variable split down by each level of the attribute explanatory variable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing the average value, of ‘Share_Price’ for all the companies who operates in a very competitive market (code 0) and the average value of ‘Share_Price’ for all companies that have a great deal of monopoly power (code 1).</li>

<p>Once we get the required statistics we need to interpret these descriptive statistics of the two sub-distributions in order to make a conclusion about their equality, i.e. similarity as we are working with sample data. In other words, based on the statistics obtained, we need to answer the following question: Are the sub-distributions the same or different?</p>
<p>{{% notice note %}}
Descriptive statistics describes data – it summarises and organises all of the collected data into something manageable and simple to understand. Yet, it could be difficult to interpret, unless you are very in tune and familiar with the variables you are observing. If you already have some prior knowledge about the subject matter you will most likely know what to expect to see and the interpretation of the statistics would not be so troublesome. However, we can always convert those statistics to a visual form which is simpler to digest and understand.
{{% /notice %}}</p>
<p>Graphical visualisation of the two sub-dustributions might help to answer this question! The <strong>boxplots</strong> are the standard graphical method of displaying this sort of data. The <strong>boxplots</strong> enables both the difference in means relative to their spreads (variability) to be assessed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#par(mfrow=c(1,1))
boxplot(Share_Price ~ Competition, data = companyd, boxwex = 0.25, main=&quot;Share Price vs Competition&quot;, xlab =&quot;Share_Price&quot;, ylab =&quot;Competition&quot;, col=c(&quot;palegreen3&quot;, &quot;orchid3&quot;), horizontal=T) </code></pre>
<p><img src="/module3/MvA/_index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>From the obtained descriptive statistics visualised by the Boxplots the means are 530.00 for the companies which operate in a very competitive market and 675.50 for the companies that have a great deal of monopoly power. The key question now is:</p>
<p>Is the difference between the two means (675.50 – 530.00 = 145.50) indicating a real difference or is this difference a difference that could have occurred by chance as a result of sampling error?</p>
<p>This is a complex question but by matching the means and the boxplots obtained in the analysis against the boxplots for the three possible model outcomes discussed earlier when talking about methodology used form MvA(2) a suitable decision can be made. For the example <code>Share_Price</code> vs <code>Competition</code> given above the analytical process is describe below:</p>
<p>By matching the boxplots against the three model outcomes illustrated in the data analysis methodology diagram, the absolute difference (as above of 145.50) has limited value in isolation because the interpretation depends also on the variability of the sample data. The variability of the sample data is measured in terms of the standard deviation, and represented in the boxplot as the inter-quartile range (IQR) as the width of the box. This graphical display the boxplot enables both the difference in means relative to their spreads (variability) to be assessed. If the two boxplots appear to be one of top of each other, then the difference is consistent with sampling error. If, however the difference is such that the boxplots appear to be well separated, then the difference is indicative of a real difference in means and suggests that a connection/relationship is present. The in-between situation is a matter of judgement but if the means are different, and the boxes of the boxplots overlap considerably then this is indicative of needing further data analysis.</p>
<p>From the sample evidence following Data Analysis Methodology we can draw a conclusion that the market value of a company share does depend on the competition within which company operates. Average share price for the companies which operate in a very competitive market is 530.00, while for those that are operationg with a great deal of monopoly power is 145.50 more.</p>
<p>The outcome of the IDA has led us to the above conclusion skipping the FDA stage.</p>
<p><img src="/module1/StatsConcepts/images/DAMethodology.png?width=40pc" /></p>
<p>We recognised that this common methodology has three stages:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Initial Data Analysis</li>
<li>The Further Data Analysis</li>
<li>Describing the Relationship</li>
</ol>
<p>and that the Further Data Analysis stage may or may-not be required depending on the outcome of the ‘Initial Data Analysis’ at Stage 1. By conducting the analysis for <code>Share_Price</code> vs <code>Competition</code>, we have also realised that Stage 3 ‘Describing the Relationship’ is dependent upon establishing that a link exists between the response variable and the explanatory variable.</p>
<p>We will move further and learn how to conduct the Further Data Analysis required for this particular data analysis situation</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Further Data Analysis</strong></p>
<p>If the Initial Data Analysis is inconclusive then ‘Further Data Analysis’ is required. This further data analysis seeks to answer the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the sample evidence support the viewpoint that there is no connection between the response variable and the explanatory variable, or does it support the view that there is a link?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Further Data Analysis is procedure that enables a decision to be made, based on the sample evidence, as to one of
two outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no relationship</li>
<li>There is a relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>These statistical procedures are called <strong>hypothesis tests</strong>, which essentially provide <strong>a decision rule for choosing between one of the two outcomes</strong> “There is no relationship” or “There is a relationship” based on the sample evidence.</p>
<p>This chapter we will discuss the mechanics of the application of the hypothesis test, and not attempt to discuss the underlying theory.</p>
<p>All hypothesis tests are carried out in four stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage 1: Specifying the hypotheses.</li>
<li>Stage 2: Defining the test parameters and the decision rule.</li>
<li>Stage 3: Examining the sample evidence.</li>
<li>Stage 4: The conclusions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The data analysis situation Measured v Attribute requires two different hypotheses tests, one hypothesis test for the situation where the attribute explanatory variable has exactly two levels, and a different hypothesis test for the situation were the attribute explanatory variable has three or more levels.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS TEST: Measured Reponse v Attribute Explanatory Variable with exactly two levels</strong></p>
<p>In the section above we started to investigate does the explanatory variable <em>Competition</em> influence the response variable <em>Share_Price</em>? The implication being does market value of the companies share depend on the competitiveness of the market within which they operate. Based on the sample evidence we were able to draw a conclusion about the nature of this relationship by conducting only the IDA.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that the IDA was inconclusive and that FDA is needed in order to draw a conclusion about the relationship between the <em>Share_Price</em> and <em>Competition</em>.</p>
<p>For this data analysis situation (MvA(2)) the required further analysis is the <strong>Student’s t-test</strong>.</p>
<p>The four stages are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Stage 1</strong>: Define the hypotheses:</p>
<ul>
<li>H0: µ1 = µ2</li>
<li>H1: µ1 ≠ µ2</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Stage 2</strong>: Defining the test parameters and the decision rule.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For ‘M vs A’ problem, what is required to help decide based on the sample evidence between the two options H0 &amp; H1 is a measure of the relative separation of the boxplots. This relative measure should consider the difference between the two means and the variability of the data for both levels of the attribute. This measure of the relative separation of the boxplots should take into account the means and the standard deviations of the two samples.</p>
<p>An agreed decision rule can be formulated that specifies that if this relative measure of the separation of the boxplots is greater than a threshold value then there is a connection otherwise there is no evidence to support as link.</p>
<p>Such a measure of the relative separation of the boxplots exists and is called the ‘Student’s t Ratio’. The value of the <strong>t-ratio</strong> calculated from the sample data is normally called <strong>t_calc</strong> to emphasis the fact that it is calculated from sample data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A decision rule can now be formulated using the <strong>t_calc</strong> value. The bigger the <strong>t_calc</strong> value the larger the separation between the boxplots and the more likely it is that there is a link between the response variable and the explanatory variable. The decision rule specifies the range of values that can take to be consistent with H0, i.e. no connection, if the <strong>t_calc</strong> is outside that range then the decision rule is specifying that the sample data is consistent with H1, namely with there being a connection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is now how to specify the agreed limits. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sealy_Gosset">W. S Gossett (1876-1937)</a> who wrote under the pseudonym of “Student” proposed the t-ratio in a paper published in 1908. He also evaluated the statistical distribution of the t-ratio to enable these threshold values to be obtained. This test procedure is called a hypothesis test and the test described is commonly referred to as <strong>the student’s t-test</strong>.</p>
<p>The agreed procedure for setting up the decision rule uses the distribution of the t-ratio and splits the area under the distribution into the proportions 2½% - 95% - 2½% giving the threshold value called <strong>t_crit</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If <strong>t_calc</strong> value is <strong>numerically between</strong> the range <strong>-t_crit &amp; +t_crit</strong> then the decision rule is flagging <strong>H0</strong>. Supporting the viewpoint that <strong>there is no relationship</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>If <strong>t_calc</strong> value is <strong>numerically outside</strong> the range <strong>–t_crit &amp; +t_crit</strong> then the decision rule is flagging <strong>H1</strong>. Supporting the viewpoint that <strong>there is a relationship</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The value <strong>t_crit</strong> depends upon the sample size, through a measure called <strong>Degrees of Freedom</strong> (<strong>df</strong>). The hypothesis test described above is called the student’s <strong>t-test</strong> and is <strong>a two tailed test using the 5% level of significance</strong>.</p>
<p>{{% notice info %}}
Reference to the tables of the percentage points of the student’s t distribution will show that one of the tabulations is the two tailed test at the 5% level of significance. The value obtained from the statistical tables will be referred to as <strong>t_crit</strong>.
{{% /notice %}}</p>
<p><img src="/module3/MvA/images/t-test.png?width=40pc" /></p>
<p>As we now realise, this stage calculates two key pieces of information, the value of <strong>t_calc</strong> as calculated from the sample data and the degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom are required to enable the numerical value of <strong>t_crit</strong> to be looked up in the statistical tables or simply in R using the <code>qt(alpha, df)</code> function.</p>
