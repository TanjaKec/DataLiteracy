<p>Earlier we looked at how to examine sample data to investigate the nature of any relationship that may exist between a measured response variable and an attribute explanatory variable. This section examines how to investigate the nature of any relationship that may exist between a measured response variable and a measured explanatory variable.</p>
<p>The first step is to have a clear idea of what is meant by a connection between the response variable and the explanatory variable. The next step is to use some <strong>simple sample descriptive statistics</strong> to have a first look at the nature of the link between the response variable and the explanatory variable. This simple approach will lead to one of three conclusions, namely on the basis of the sample information:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>there is very strong evidence to support a link</li>
<li>there is absolutely no evidence of any link</li>
<li>the sample evidence is inconclusive and further more sophisticated data analysis is required</li>
</ol>
<p>This step is called the <strong>Initial Data Analysis</strong> or the <strong>IDA</strong>.</p>
<p>If the IDA suggests that <strong>Further Data Analysis</strong> is required, then this step seeks one of two conclusions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>The sample evidence is consistent with there being no link between the response variable and the explanatory variable.</li>
<li>The sample evidence is consistent with there being a link between the response variable and the explanatory variable.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we have already seen in the previous sections, this process can be represented diagrammatically as:</p>
<p><img src="/module3/DAMethodology/images/DAMethodology.png?width=40pc" /></p>
<p>The Data-Analysis Methodology seeks to find the answer to the following key question:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the basis of the sample data, is there evidence of a connection/link/relationship between the response variable and the explanatory variable?</li>
</ul>
<p>The final outcome is one of two conclusions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>There is no evidence of a relationship, labelled as the ‘No’ outcome in the diagram above, in which case the analysis is finished.</p></li>
<li><p>There is evidence of a relationship, labelled as the ‘Yes’ outcome in the diagram above, in which case the nature of the relationship needs to be described.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first step is to have a clear idea of what is meant by a connection between a measured response variable and a measured explanatory variable. Imagine a population under study consisting of a very large number of population members, and on each population member two measurements are made, the value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> the response variable and the value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> the explanatory variable. For the whole population a graph of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> against <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> could be plotted conceptually. If the graph looked as in the diagram below, then there is quite clearly a link between Y and X. If the value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is known, the exact value of Y can be read off the graph. This is an unlikely scenario in the data-analysis context, because the relationship shown is a <strong>deterministic relationship</strong>. <em>Deterministic means that if the value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is known then the value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> can be precisely determined from the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><img src="/module3/MvM/images/deterministic_relationship.png?width=40pc" /></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Scatter Plot</strong></p>
<p>When analysing the relationship between the two measured variable we start off by creating a scatter plot. A scatter plot is a graph that shows one axis for explanatory variable commonly known in the regression modelling as a predictor and labelled with <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and one axis for the response variable, which is labelled with <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and commonly known as the outcome variable. Thus, each point on the graph represents a single <span class="math inline">\((X, Y)\)</span> pair. The primary benefit is that the possible relationship between the two variables can be viewed and analysed with one glance and often the nature of a relationship can be determined quickly and easily.</p>
<p>Let us consider a few scatter plots. The following graph represents a <strong>perfect linear relationship</strong>, all points lie exactly on a straight line. It is easy in this situation to determine the intercept and the slope, ie. gradient and hence specify the exact mathematical link between the response variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and the explanatory variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>-<strong>Graph 1</strong></p>
<p><img src="/module3/MvM/images/Yes_perfect.png?width=30pc" /></p>
<p>The relationship shown in <em>Graph 2</em> shows clearly that as the value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> increases the value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> indecreases, but not exactly on a straight line as in the previous scatter plot. This is showing a statistical link, as the value of the explanatory variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> increases the value of the response variable also <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> tends to increase. An explanation for this is that the response <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> may depend on a number of different variables, say <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X_3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X_4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X_5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X_6\)</span> etc. which could be written as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Y = f(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5, X_6, ...)\)</span></p>
<p>-<strong>Graph 2</strong></p>
<p><img src="/module3/MvM/images/Yes_50.png?width=30pc" /></p>
<p>If the nature of the link between <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is under investigation then this could be represented as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y = f(X) + \text{effect of all other variables}\]</span></p>
<p>{{% notice note %}}
The effect of all other variables is commonly abbreviated to <strong>e</strong>.
{{% /notice %}}</p>
<p><em>Graph 1</em> shows a link were the effect of al the other variables is nil. The response <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> depends solely on the variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <em>Graph 2</em> shows a situation were <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> depends on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> but the other variables also have an influence.</p>
<p>Considered the model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y = f(X) + e\]</span>
Remember 😃, <span class="math inline">\(\text{e is the effect of all other variables}\)</span>!</p>
<p>The influence on the response variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> can be thought of as being made up of two components:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>the component of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> that is explained by changes in the value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, [the part due to changes in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> through <span class="math inline">\(f(X)\)</span>]</li>
<li>the component of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> that is explained by changes in the other factors [the part not explained by changes in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>]</li>
</ol>
<p>Or in more abbreviated forms:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>the <em>Variation in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> Explained by changes <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span></em> or <strong>Explained Variation</strong> and</li>
<li>the <em>Variation in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> not explained by changes in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span></em> or the <strong>Unexplained Variation</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Total Variation in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are made up of the two components:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Changes in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> Explained by changes in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span></em> and the</li>
<li><em>Changes in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> not explained by changes in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span></em></li>
</ol>
<p>Which may be written as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{The Total Variation in Y} = \text{Explained Variation} + \text{Unexplained Variation}\]</span></p>
<p>In <em>Graph 1</em> the <strong>Unexplained Variation is nil</strong>, since the value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is completely determined by the value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. In <em>Graph 2</em> the <strong>Explained Variation is large relative to the Unexplained Variation</strong>, since the value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is very largely influenced by the value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider Graph 3. Here there is no discernible pattern, and the value of Y seems to be unrelated to the value of X.</p>
<p><strong>- Graph 3</strong></p>
<p><img src="/module3/MvM/images/No_relationship.png?width=30pc" /></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is not related to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> the <strong>Explained Variation component is zero</strong> and all the changes in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are due to the other variables, that is the <strong>Unexplained Variation</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, consider Graphs 4 &amp; 5 below:</p>
<p>-<strong>Graph 4</strong></p>
<p><img src="/module3/MvM/images/Yes_75.png?width=30pc" /></p>
<p>-<strong>Graph 5</strong></p>
<p><img src="/module3/MvM/images/deterministic_neg.png?width=30pc" /></p>
<p><em>Graph 4</em> shows a similar picture to <em>Graph 2</em>, the difference being that as the value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> increases the value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> decreases. The value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is influenced by the value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, so the <strong>Explained Variation is high relative to the Unexplained Variation</strong>. Consider the last graph, <em>Graph 5</em>, this is a deterministic relationship, <strong>the value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is completely specified by the value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span></strong>. Hence the <strong>Unexplained Variation is zero</strong>.</p>

<p>In regression the discussion started with the following idea:
<span class="math display">\[Y = f(X) + e\]</span>
And to quantify the strength of the link the influence on Y was broken down into two components:
i. <span class="math display">\[\text{The Total Variation in Y} = \text{Explained Variation} + \text{Unexplained Variation}\]</span></p>
<p>This presents two issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>A: Can a model of the link be made?</li>
<li>B: Can <strong>The Total Variation in Y</strong>, <strong>Explained Variation</strong> and the <strong>Unexplained Variation</strong> be measured?</li>
</ul>
<p>{{% notice note %}}
The simplest form of connection is a straight-line relationship and the question arises could a straight-line relationship be matched with the information contained in the graphs 1 -5?
{{% /notice %}}</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly it is easy for Graph 1 and Graph 5, the intercept and the gradient can be obtained directly from the graph. The relationship can then be written as:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y = a + bX\]</span>
where:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>a is the intercept and</p></li>
<li><p>b is the gradient</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Since the <strong>Explained Variation</strong> is the same as the <strong>Changes in Y</strong> and the <strong>Unexplained Variation</strong> <strong>is zero</strong>, the precise evaluation of these is not necessary.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Developing a Statistical Model</strong></p>
<p>For the statistical relationships as shown in <em>Graphs</em> <em>2</em> &amp; <em>4</em> can:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The intercept and gradient be measured?</p></li>
<li><p>The values of the three quantities <em>The Total Variation in Y</em>, <em>Explained Variation</em> and <em>The Unexplained Variation</em> be measured?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is sufficient to work out any two since:
<span class="math display">\[\text{The Total Variation in Y} = \text{Explained Variation} + \text{Unexplained Variation}\]</span></p>
<p>Fitting a line by eye is subjective. It is unlikely that any two analysts will draw exactly the same line, hence the intercept and gradient will be slightly different from one person to the next. What is needed is an agreed method that will provide an estimate of the intercept and the gradient.</p>
<p>Consider the simple numerical example below:</p>
<p>Suppose we would like to fit a straight-line relationship to the following data:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><span class="math inline">\(X\)</span></th>
<th>1</th>
<th>2</th>
<th>3</th>
<th>4</th>
<th>5</th>
<th>6</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span></td>
<td>7</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>12</td>
<td>13</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>18</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The problem is to use this information to measure <strong>the intercept</strong> and <strong>the gradient</strong> for this data set.</p>
<p>A simple way to do this is to draw what is considered to be <strong>the line of best fit</strong> by judgement or guesswork! 😁😉</p>
<p><strong>The intercept</strong> can be read off the graph as approximately <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, and <strong>the gradient</strong> can be simply measured since if <span class="math inline">\(X = 0\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(Y = 5\)</span>, and if <span class="math inline">\(X = 5\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(Y = 15\)</span>, so for a change in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> units (from 0 to 5) <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> changes by <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>, from <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(15\)</span>. The definition of <strong>the gradient</strong> is <strong>The change in Y for a unit increase in X</strong> hence the gradient for this data set is <span class="math inline">\(15/5 = 2\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="/module3/MvM/_index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The straight-line relationship obtained by this process is <span class="math display">\[\hat{Y} = 5 + 2*X\]</span>.<br />
Note, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y}\)</span> is a notation for the value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> as predicted by the straight-line relationship.</p>
<p>We can add more information about the predicted values of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> by the <em>“estimated”</em> model to our table, so that we have</p>
<table>

<p>Looking at the information contained in the previous plot, the column headed <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y}\)</span> contains the predicted values of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> for the values of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. For example, the first value of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y}\)</span> is when <span class="math inline">\(X = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Yp = 5 + 2*X\)</span> so <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y} = 5 +2*1 = 7\)</span>. The column headed <span class="math inline">\((Y - \hat{Y})\)</span> is the difference between the actual value and the value predicted by the line. For example when <span class="math inline">\(X = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Y = 7\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y} = 7\)</span> so the predicted value lies on the line, as can be seen in the graph. For the value <span class="math inline">\(X = 2\)</span> the actual value lies <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> unit below the line, again as can be seen from the graph.</p>
<p>The column <span class="math inline">\((Y - \hat{Y})\)</span> <strong>measures the disagreement between the actual data and the line</strong> and a sensible strategy is to <strong>make this level of disagreement as small as possible</strong>. Referring to the graph on the table above notice that sometimes the actual data value is below the line and sometimes it is above the line, so on average the value will be close to zero. In this particular example the sum of the <span class="math inline">\((Y - \hat{Y})\)</span> values add to zero (in a more conventional notation <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma(Y - \hat{Y}) = 0\)</span>). The quantity <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma(Y - \hat{Y})\)</span> does not seem to be a satisfactory measure of disagreement, because there are a number of different lines with the property <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma(Y - \hat{Y}) = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>A way of obtaining a satisfactory measure of disagreement is to square the individual <span class="math inline">\((Y - \hat{Y})\)</span> values and add them up</strong>. i.e. obtain the quantity <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma(Y - \hat{Y})^2\)</span>. The result is always a positive number since the square of a negative number is positive. If this quantity is then chosen to be as small as possible then the level of disagreement between the actual data points and the fitted line is the least. This provides a criterion for the choice of the best line.</p>
<p>The quantity <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma(Y - \hat{Y})^2\)</span> can be easily calculated and added to our table</p>

<p>The quantity <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma(Y - \hat{Y})^2\)</span> is a measure of the disagreement between the actual <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> values and the values predicted by the line. If this value is chosen to be as small as possible then the disagreement between the actual Y values and the line is the smallest it could possibly be, hence the line is <strong>The line of Best Fit</strong>.</p>
<p>This procedure of finding the intercept and the gradient of a line that makes the quantity <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma(Y - \hat{Y})^2\)</span> a minimum is called <strong>The Method of Least Squares</strong>.</p>

<p>The final issue is to find out how to measure the three quantities:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>The Total Variation in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span></li>
<li>The Explained Variation</li>
<li>The Unexplained Variation</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking these quantities one at a time they can be measured as follows:</p>
<p><strong>The ’Unexplained Variation</strong></p>
<p>This turns out to be very simple to measure, the quantity: <strong><span class="math inline">\(\Sigma(Y - \hat{Y})^2\)</span> is a measure of the Unexplained Variation</strong>. If the line were a perfect fit to the data, the value predicted by the line and the actual value would be exactly the same and the value of the quantity <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma(Y - \hat{Y})^2\)</span> would be zero. This quantity is a measure of the disagreement between the actual <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> values and the predicted values <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y}\)</span>,which are also known as <strong>the residuals</strong> and are measuring the <strong>Unexplained Variation in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span></strong>. For the example used above the value of <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma(Y - \hat{Y})^2\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(3.77\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>The Total Variation in Y</strong></p>
<p>This is related to the measures of variability (spread) introduced earlier in the course and in particular to the standard deviation (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>). To measure <em>The Total Variation in Y</em> requires a measure of spread.</p>
<p><em>The Total Variation in Y</em> is defined to be the quantity:
<span class="math inline">\(\Sigma(Y - \bar{Y})^2\)</span>
Where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Y}\)</span> is the average value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\bar{Y} = \Sigma(Y)/n\)</span>).</p>
<p>In our earlier example <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Y} = 12\)</span>, so we can expand the table to include this calculation</p>

<p>incorporating this calculation into the table above will enable us to get <span class="math inline">\((\hat{Y} - \bar{Y})^2 = 78.23\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The coefficient of Determination <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span></strong></p>
<p>We realise that when fitting a regression model we are seeking to find out how much variance is explained, or is accounted for, by the explanitary variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> in an outcome variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>From the above example the following has been calculated:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\text{The Total Variation in }\)</span><span class="math inline">\(Y = 82.00\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\text{The Explained Variation in }\)</span><span class="math inline">\(Y = 78.23\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\text{The Unexplained Variation in }\)</span><span class="math inline">\(Y = 3.77\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Notice the relationship proposed on page 5, given below, is satisfied</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{The Total Variation in Y = Explained Variation + Unexplained Variation}\]</span></p>
<pre><code>$$82.00 = 78.23 + 3.77$$</code></pre>
<p>What do these quantities tell us? They are difficult to interpret because they are expressed in the units of the problem.</p>
<p>Consider the following ratio:</p>
<pre><code>$${\text{The Explained Variation in Y} \over \text{The Total Variation in Y}} = {78.23 \over 82.00} = 0.954$$</code></pre>
<p>This is saying that <span class="math inline">\(0.954\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(95.4\%\)</span> of the changes in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are explained by changes in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. This is a useful and useable measure of the effectiveness of the match between the actual <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> values and the predicted <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> values.</p>
<p>Reviewing the five scatter prolts (Graph 1 to 5) it can easily be seen that if the line is a perfect fit to the actual <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> values as in <em>Graphs 1 &amp; 5</em> then this ratio will have the value <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(100\%\)</span>.</p>
<p>If there is no link between <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> then the <em>The Explained Variation</em> is zero hence the ratio will be <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(0\%\)</span> an example of this is shown in <em>Graph 3</em>.</p>
<p>The remaining graphs: <em>Graphs 2 &amp; 4</em> show a statistical relationship hence this ratio will lie between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> &amp; <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. The closer the ratio is to zero the less strong the link is, whilst the closer the ratio is to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> the stronger the connection is between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> &amp; <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>The Ratio:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R^2 = {\text{The Explained Variation in Y} \over \text{The Total Variation in Y}}\]</span></p>
<p>is called <strong>the Coefficient of Determination</strong>, and usually labeled as <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>, and may be defined as <strong>the proportion of the changes in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> explained by changes in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span></strong>.</p>
<p>This ratio is always on the scale <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, but by convention is usually expressed as a percentage so is regarded as on the scale <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(100\%\)</span>. The interpretation of this ratio is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/module3/MvM/images/R_sq_interp.png?width=30pc" /></p>
<p>The definition and interpretation of <strong><span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span></strong> is a very <strong>important tool</strong> in the data analyst tool kit <strong>for tracking connections between a measures response variable and a measured explanatory variable</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Using Sample Data to Track a connection</strong></p>
<p>When working with sample data to investigate any relationships that may exist between a measured response variable and a measured explanatory variable the information contained within the sample is imperfect, so has to be interpreted in the light of sampling error. This is particularly important when interpreting the value of R2 calculated from sample data. The sample R2 value gives a measure of the strength of the connection, and this can sometimes be difficult to interpret particularly if the sample size is small.</p>
<p>The data analysis methodology as set out in earlier, is a procedure that enables the you to make judgements from sample data. The methodology requires you to know what specific procedures make up the Initial Data Analysis IDA and how to interpret the results of the IDA to obtain one of three outcomes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>No evidence of a connection between the response and the explanatory variable</li>
<li>Clear evidence of a connection between the response and the explanatory variable</li>
<li>The IDA is inconclusive and further analysis is required</li>
</ol>
<p>If Further Data Analysis FDA is required then you needs to know what constitutes this further analysis and how to interpret it.</p>
<p>Finally, if a connection between the response variable and the explanatory variable is detected then a description of the connection is required. In this case the connection the connection needs to be described.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the data analysis methodology we’ll go back to Share Price Study Case Study.</p>
<p><strong>Share Price Study Data</strong></p>
<p>A business analyst is studying share prices of companies from three different business sectors. As part of the study a random sample (n=60) of companies was selected and the following data was collected:</p>

<p>Let’s start off by investigating the relationship between the variables <code>Share_Price</code> and <code>Profit</code>.</p>
<p>We will adopt the following notation</p>
